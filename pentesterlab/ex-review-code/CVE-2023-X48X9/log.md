The `Algorithm.HMAC256` is a strong algorithm for cryptographic hashing ==> not WEAK AL
No `Hardcoded Secrets`

Look around i realized i fail, when i saw HMAC256, I skiped this code line, but, thought this code using HMAC SHA256 but String to encoded is `static`, meaning this code is Hardcoded Secrets.
